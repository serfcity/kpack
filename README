0. WHAT IS IT?
--------------
Kpack is a KolibriOS-NG archiver, which uses liblzma.


1. HOW TO BUILD?
----------------
You should have a ANSI C compiler and BSD Make and liblzma library.
Set optimization options (or debug options):
  `export CFLAGS="-02"' -- for release build
  `export CFLAGS="-O0 -g"' -- for debug build
And type `bmake'.
